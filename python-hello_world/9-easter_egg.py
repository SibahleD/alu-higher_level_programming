print(f"The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\n\
Explicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\n\
Complex is better than complicated.\nFlat is better than nested.\n\
Sparse is better than dense.\nReadability counts.\n\
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n\
Although practicality beats purity.\n\
Errors should never pass silently.\nUnless explicitly silenced.\n\
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n\
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\
\nAlthough that way may not be obvious at first unless \
you're Dutch.\nNow is better than never.\nAlthough never is often \
better than *right* now.\nIf the implementation is hard to explain, \
it's a bad idea.\nIf the implementation is easy to explain, it may \
be a good idea.\nNamespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do \
more of those!")
